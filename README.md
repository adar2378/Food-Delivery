## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

You will need Xampp installed on your pc or an online php hosting.

### Installing

Download Xampp from this link: https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html and install it.

## Deployment

Deployment on a local PC:
*	Copy all the files to a folder called “Foodie”.
*	Copy the folder “Foodie” to a folder inside the directory where XAMPP is installed, called “htdocs”.
*	Open XAMPP and press the first two “Start” buttons to turn your PC into the server.
*	Open a web browser (i.e. Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox).
*	Type in the following address: localhost/Foodie.
*	Now, type in the following address: localhost/phpmyadmin
*	Import the .sql file from the “database” folder, which is inside the “Foodie” folder of “htdocs”.
Now, you can use our website on your PC.

Deployment online: 
*	Let’s assume we bought the domain “foodie.com”.
*	We will also need to rent a web-server and bandwidth from a hosting service.
*	The hosting service will give us access to the server, where we can upload files and install custom scripts to keep our site up and running.
